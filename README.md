# Hydro-Client

1.8.8 

pasted intent store client

this is a client I used to dev with DemoDev (who is currently scamming people for a shit intent store paste, which is just a rename of this)

I left becuz Demo doesn't know shit about Java and only skidded random shit from github and source leaks.

here you will find very autistic skidded code, including a completely skidded Wrapper from Fan client, SpicyClient notifications, intents event system, and more cancerous dogshit.

if you came here to skid, keep in mind this is the worst possible source leak to skid from.

And no, I never skidded or wrote any meaningful code for this shit client.
